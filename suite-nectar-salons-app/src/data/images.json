I spent most of my career in Miami, learning my craft and developing my technique. I started going to tattoo conventions in 2018 throughout the east coast, hopping from one city to another. This allowed me to grow and learn even more. I first came to Charlotte for the tattoo convention in October 2018. It was my first time in North Carolina and I fell in love with the city and the state immediately. I moved here in 2020 during the pandemic and opened my own space in 2022. I love tattooing and I specialize in various styles, mostly black and grey and color realism. I do enjoy neotraditional and Japanese tattoos as well. I’m also a painter. I love to draw and paint when I’m not tattooing. Another hobby and passion of mine is travel. I often tattoo in other states and cities as well.
